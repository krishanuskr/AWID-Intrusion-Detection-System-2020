# AWID-Intrusion-Detection-System-2020
Detecting and classifying wireless attacks using Machine Learning Models on AWID dataset

Request to download the AWID (Aegean Wi-fi Intrusion) Dataset from http://icsdweb.aegean.gr/awid/download.html

Load the jupyter notebook on Google colab, and mount the AWID-CLS-R-Trn and Tst files on Google Drive. Ensure the path matches on the notebook. Change accordingly.

The Dataset.zip contains the final csv obtained after AWID_Implementation

Use the dataset obtained from the zip with application.py

Install streamlit and other dependencies on your system. Ensure both the dataset and the python file are in the same directory.

Open VS CODE/similar IDE, open a terminal and enter "streamlit run application.py" to run. This will launch a web app to visualize accuracies of different models used.

A more detailed project report may be added later.
